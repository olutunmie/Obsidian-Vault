I have missed a lot of days without documenting what happened in my head

I feel like shit this morning. I have not repaired my phone and and I masturbated the second time this year.. I really hate doing this to myself. I should have went for a vigil but instead came inside to sleep to avoid huan interaction.

I am still in between learning how laravel works and I am intrigued by how phoenix works.. 
I learnt this is a symptoms of obsessive compulsion.. 

I have to keep working even when i am failing.. The main thing is to keep working
