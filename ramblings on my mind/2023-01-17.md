There are just days you ask yourself how you got here. What decisions lead you where you are? Who truly was leading your life, was it you? 

You roll on the bed for house tossing about trying to find meaning to how you are living your life. But the thing is you lead your self here and you have to know you lead your life to that dark space even though there were people who you think might be a part of it. Then you have to change those people and make your decision in a better way. Make more friends and make more money I guess
