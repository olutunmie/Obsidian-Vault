## To new begining

This is the second day of the year. I want to give myself to more reading and writing (journalling). I want to find something I want to put my energy on. I have been trying figure out, web3, animation(game development), flutter, native development, phoenix, will learn all this all through the year. But need to start with something. I want to go with blender something new, but I will keep with Native development and focus web3 and animation during weekends.

I will read more long-form essays. Read, read and read and comprehend what i am reading by writing more

I guess I will be using this more and more. I like the whole vibe it is giving
